        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I got this recipe from my old manager. It sounded so simple I had to try 
            it out. I love pepperoncini peppers and there were only 5 ingredients. 
            Sounds like the perfect meal for a busy family. I did not expect it to become 
            a go to recipe and shoot up the leaderboard like it did. However, it's so good
            I'm not even a little bit mad about it.
