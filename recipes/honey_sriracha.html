        <h1>Honey Sriracha Protein Bowl</h1>
        <img src="../images/hnysri.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            My wife found this recipe on Pinterest and it has very quickly become
            a staple in the Jones Family Household. My son (who does not like spicy
            food) likes it. Plus, it's spice is totally customizeable depending on 
            how much Sriracha you add into it. The original recipe calls for broccolli 
            and, while we love broccoli, we have found that zucchini is the vegetable 
            that goes best in this dish. It rides the line between the 
            honey sweet and the spicy sriracha in a perfect way.
            I haven't found a better flavor since.

                    <li>1 lbs. ground chicken</li>
                    <li>1/4 C Sweet Chili Sauce</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp Honey</li>
                    <li>1-3 Tbsp Sriracha(for your spice preference)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Ground Ginger</li>
                    <li>Sesame Seeds and Green Onion for garnish</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 1/2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                        Add the broccoli and leave untouched for 1-2 minutes to develop some 
                        browning on one side. Stir and continue cooking until the broccoli 
                        is a dark green, about 3-4 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and 
                        set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet and brown both sides of 
                        the ground chicken before mincing and fully cooking.</li>
                    <li>While the chicken cooks, mix the remaining sauce ingredients together. 
                        Add the sauce to the fully cooked chicken and cook until thick. 
                        Be careful not to burn.</li>
                    <li>Once the sauce is thick, add the broccoli back to the skillet and stir 
                        everything together. 
                        Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion before serving.</li>                    
                </ol>
