        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="cfr body">
            This recipe is one of my family favorites! We have it at least 
            once every two to three weeks or so. the flavors of the sesame oil and brown rice 
            combine so nicely with the chicken, eggs, and rice in this dish.
            My son asks for it all the time! we haven't made it correctly with 
            old rice yet.  Only fresh. We are very excited to see what it tastes like with leftover rice the way that it's supposed to be made.
            apparently refrying the rice adds more flavor so I lament that we've only used fresh rice before, however,
            very excited for the next time we make it.
